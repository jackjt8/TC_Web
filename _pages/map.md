## 🗺️ Map Legend

The Dynmap includes custom icons to help identify important locations across Tamriel:

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 🏙️ | Major city or capital |
| 🏘️ | Town or village |
| 🏡 | Farm or homestead |
| ⛪ | Temple, chapel, or religious site |
| 🏰 | Fort, castle, or military outpost |
| ⛏️ | Mine or industrial location |
| 🌲 | Wilderness area or point of interest |
| 📍 | Planned build or placeholder |
| ❌ | Deprecated/legacy location |


Hover over markers for the name of the build.

Many key locations can be teleported to using '/warp ...'.
