If you've noticed some strange happenings on the server lately—performance dips, shifting terrain, the occasional chunk refusing to load, or server connectivity issues—you’re not alone. Things have been a little bumpy behind the scenes, and we want to shed some light on what’s going on, and more importantly, why it’s worth the hassle.

> As always, the best way to stay in the loop is to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/ApShrYn), where we post smaller updates and sneak peeks in real time.

## The Vision, Years in the Making

Nearly ten years ago, one of our most dedicated builders, **Fonta59**, set out to recreate **Skyrim** as faithfully as possible. It became a standalone passion project, running parallel to TamrielCraft’s main map.

Some of Fonta’s work has made it into the live server over the years—cities like **Whiterun**, **Solitude**, and **Winterhold** are already familiar to long-time players. But a huge chunk of the project remained separate. The reason? The terrain and scale tweaks were so extensive that integrating the full build would have required massive changes to our existing map.

**Until now.**

## What’s Happening Behind the Scenes

Fonta is currently in the process of merging his entire overhauled Skyrim into the main TamrielCraft world. This includes:

- Major **terrain overhauls** across the province  
- Integration of **unreleased cities, towns, and ruins**  
- Adjustments to **elevation, roads, rivers, and borders** for better regional cohesion

This kind of integration is... well, monumental. It requires hours of world editing, careful alignment, and no small amount of server resources. As we blend old and new, some side effects—like lag spikes, terrain anomalies, or visual bugs—are to be expected.

## Why It Matters

Despite the disruption, this is one of the most exciting milestones in TamrielCraft's history.

We’re moving toward a version of Skyrim that feels *immersive*, *cohesive*, and *faithful*. Every hold and mountain pass will be recreated accurately and in immense detail, all lovingly crafted block by block.

## Looking Ahead

We want to thank everyone for their patience while we carry out this massive update. We’re working hard to minimize downtime and ensure the world remains stable as we go.

And most of all, thank you to **Fonta** for his years of tireless work, and to **every builder, contributor, and supporter** helping bring Tamriel to life—one block at a time.

Stay tuned... the best is yet to come.
